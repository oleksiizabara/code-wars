                Task
                Your task in the kata is to determine how many boats are sunk damaged and untouched 
                from a set amount of attacks. You will need to create a function that takes two arguments, 
                the playing board and the attacks.


                Boats are placed either horizontally, vertically or diagonally on the board. 
                0 represents a space not occupied by a boat. Digits 1-3 represent boats which vary in 
                length 1-4 spaces long. There will always be at least 1 boat up to a maximum of 3 in any one game. 
                Boat sizes and board dimentions will vary from game to game.

                Attacks
                Attacks are calculated from the bottom left, first the X coordinate then the Y. 
                There will be at least one attack per game, and the array will not contain duplicates.

                Scoring
                1 point for every whole boat sank.
                0.5 points for each boat hit at least once (not including boats that are sunk).
                -1 point for each whole boat that was not hit at least once.
                Sunk or Damaged
                sunk = all boats that are sunk
                damaged = all boats that have been hit at least once but not sunk
                notTouched/not_touched = all boats that have not been hit at least once
            -->
