            <!--    
                Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that wants to invest, 
                and he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum has to be 
                kept in the bank in order for this sum of money to amount to 'D'.

                The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid 
                yearly, and the new sum is re-invested yearly after paying tax 'T'
        
                Note that the principal is not taxed but only the year's accrued interest
            -->

    <script>
        function calculateYears(principal, interest, tax, desired) {
            var years = 0;

            while (desired > principal) {
              principal += principal*interest*(1 - tax);
              years ++;
            }
            return years;
        }
